**EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ASSESSMENT 2019**

**Instructions**
```bash
This assessment concerns the well-known MNIST [7] dataset and the Python [1] packages
keras [6], flask [5], and jupyter [4].
```

**How to get started & Run the app**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/smoran98/EmergingTechnologiesG00338607

Download and install Anaconda
Requirements:
$ conda install -c anaconda flask
$ conda install -c conda-forge keras tensorflow
$ conda install -c anaconda pillow
$ conda install -c conda-forge opencv

open Terminal(CMD)
cd Webapp
set FLASK_APP=flaskapp.py
flask run

```

**Tutorial Video Requirements**
```bash
•	Show and give a very brief overview of repository page in GitHub - running through your README, files and folders.
•	Give a brief overview of your web application code.
•	Give a brief demonstration of your web application running.
•	Give a brief overview of your notebook.

•	It would greatly help if you have all of the pages, codes and applications already open and running before you press record so that you can easily flick through them.

```

**Minimum Viable Project**
```bash
The minimum standard for this assessment is a git repository containing a README file
written in Markdown [3], a jupyter notebook containing code to train your model, and
a flask web application that allows users to recognise digits using your trained model.
The README should contain a summary of your work and provide instructions as to
how to run the jupyter notebook and the web application.
A good project will be well laid out, clear and concise, and easily understood and
run. The trained model will accurately predict digits as drawn by the user, and the web
application will provide a good user experience
```

**Marking scheme**
```bash
Presentation

20% Presentation 
Well-organised, easily understood repository with good
documentation. Able to explain all contents of repository in discussion.

Model
20% Research 
Clear evidence of research into developing the model
with references to other works evident within the jupyter
notebook.
20% Documentation 
Clear explanation and documentation of training the
model using a jupyter notebook.


Application
20% Code 
Simple, straight-forward code with appropriate comments and decent architecture.

20% User exp. 
Good user experience – easy to use, well-designed frontend with good feedback to the user and efficient submission to the model.
