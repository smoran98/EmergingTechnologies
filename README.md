**EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ASSESSMENT 2019**

**Instructions**
```
This assessment concerns the well-known MNIST [7] dataset and the Python [1] packages
keras [6], flask [5], and jupyter [4].
```

**Minimum Viable Project**
```
The minimum standard for this assessment is a git repository containing a README file
written in Markdown [3], a jupyter notebook containing code to train your model, and
a flask web application that allows users to recognise digits using your trained model.
The README should contain a summary of your work and provide instructions as to
how to run the jupyter notebook and the web application.
A good project will be well laid out, clear and concise, and easily understood and
run. The trained model will accurately predict digits as drawn by the user, and the web
application will provide a good user experience
```

**Marking scheme**
```
